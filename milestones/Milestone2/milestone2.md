##  What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

My current goal is to visually and intuitively show how democracy relates to economic growth.
Additionally, I aim to highlight that regime status—often perceived as rigid—can shift under the right conditions (e.g., shocks, coalitions, regional waves). The goal remains the same, with a wider focus on relate visulization to evidence-based interpretations.

##  Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

Yes. The democracy–growth relationship is not straightforward (endogeneity, measurement error, time lags), so before plotting I ran exploratory checks, reviewed literature, and examined prior visualizations to ensure the charts make sense.
This required exploring almost 10 additional tables from different sources; a few promising sources remain to be explored. Only Visualization 6 used mock data; everything else relies on observed data.
