# Democracy Paradox

Jose Pajuelo

## Description

This project is an article that explores a crucial issue in contemporary democracy.

If democracy does indeed cause growth, why is it now moving backward?
The narrative of the article follows two main ideas:

• Democracy does cause growth
• Explaining the backsliding of recent years

The visualizations are designed to support and clarify these arguments 
while making the discussion more engaging and accessible.

I expect this to be the first part of a broader project that will later 
be complemented by a dynamic, interactive version.
